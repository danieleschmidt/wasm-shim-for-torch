# GitHub Actions Workflows Documentation

This document outlines the recommended CI/CD workflows for the WASM Shim for Torch project.

## Overview

The project requires comprehensive CI/CD workflows to ensure code quality, security, and reliable builds across multiple platforms. This documentation provides templates and requirements for GitHub Actions workflows.

## Required Workflows

- Upload coverage reports
- Run security scans (bandit, safety)

**Triggers**:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch
- Manual dispatch

### 2. Build and Package

**Key Steps**:
- Build packages
- Run full test suite
- Create GitHub release
- Upload to PyPI
- Update documentation

**Triggers**:
- Push of version tags (v*)

### 5. Documentation

**File**: `.github/workflows/docs.yml`

**Purpose**: Build and deploy documentation.

**Key Steps**:
- Build Sphinx documentation
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Link checking
- Documentation linting

**Triggers**:
- Push to main branch
- Manual dispatch

## Workflow Templates

### Environment Setup Template

```yaml
name: Setup Python Environment
uses: ./.github/actions/setup-python
with:
  python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
  cache-dependency-path: pyproject.toml
```

### Emscripten Setup Template

```yaml
name: Setup Emscripten
run: |
  git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
  cd emsdk
  ./emsdk install latest
  ./emsdk activate latest
  echo "EMSDK=$(pwd)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
  echo "$(pwd)" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

### Security Scanning Template

```yaml
name: Security Scan
uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
with:
  languages: python
  queries: security-and-quality
```

## Required Secrets

The following secrets must be configured in the repository:

- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: PyPI API token for package uploads
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov token for coverage reports
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub

## Required Permissions

Workflows require the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  actions: read
  checks: write
  pull-requests: write
```

## Branch Protection Rules

Recommended branch protection settings for `main`:

- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Required status checks:
  - `ci / test-python-3.10`
  - `ci / test-python-3.11` 
  - `ci / test-python-3.12`
  - `ci / lint`
  - `ci / security-scan`
- Require review from code owners
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- Require signed commits

## Environment Variables

Common environment variables used across workflows:

```yaml
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.10"
  NODE_VERSION: "18"
  EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION: "latest"
  PYTEST_ARGS: "--cov=wasm_torch --cov-report=xml"
```

## Caching Strategy

Optimize build times with strategic caching:

```yaml
# Python dependencies
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('pyproject.toml') }}

# Emscripten cache
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: emsdk-cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-emsdk-${{ hashFiles('Makefile') }}
```

## Artifact Management

Store and share build artifacts:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: wasm-modules
    path: build/*.wasm
    retention-days: 30
```

## Deployment Environments

Configure deployment environments:

- **staging**: Auto-deploy from main branch
- **production**: Manual approval required for releases

## Monitoring and Notifications

Set up monitoring for workflow health:

- Slack notifications for failed builds
- Email notifications for security alerts
- Status badges in README

## Manual Setup Instructions

Since GitHub Actions files cannot be automatically created, repository maintainers should:

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Implement workflows based on the templates above
3. Configure required secrets in repository settings
4. Set up branch protection rules
5. Configure deployment environments

## Integration with External Services

### CodeCov Integration

Add to pyproject.toml:
```toml
[tool.coverage.report]
service_name = "github"
```

### Dependabot Configuration

Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

## Compliance and Auditing

Workflows should support:

- SOX compliance through audit trails
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Security compliance scanning
- License compliance verification

## Performance Optimization

Optimize workflow performance:

- Use matrix strategies for parallel execution
- Implement smart caching strategies
- Use appropriate runner types (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest)
- Minimize checkout depth where possible

## Troubleshooting

Common workflow issues and solutions:

1. **Emscripten setup failures**: Ensure proper caching and path configuration
2. **Test failures in CI but not locally**: Check for environment differences
3. **Security scan false positives**: Configure appropriate ignore lists
4. **Deployment failures**: Verify secrets and permissions

## Workflow Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

- Update action versions quarterly
- Review and update security scanning rules
- Monitor workflow performance and optimize
- Update documentation as workflows evolve

This documentation should be updated as workflows are implemented and refined based on project needs and CI/CD best practices.
